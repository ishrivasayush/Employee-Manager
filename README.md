## Brief Summary
- I developed a **RESTful API** using **Spring Boot and MySQL for the back-end**, tested it with **Postman**, and integrated it into a **React front-end using axios**.
- **CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD)** appliction.
- This repository contains the **back-end** of a **Full Stack** **personal project**, which is **responsible for storing employee information** and is implemented using the **Spring Boot Java Framework** which serves as the **web framework** for the **back-end**.
- This application allows users to **view, add, remove, and edit** individuals within their management system.
- This project is now **fully utilised** by my **community's sports club**.

## ‚úèÔ∏èDesign - Back-end
### Back-end Technology Stack
- **Java** served as the **back-end programming language** for the web application, while the **Spring Boot framework** was employed to **facilitate its development and operation**.
- **Spring Boot** was utilised to **create user models**, which were subsequently employed to **store employee information in the database**. The user models were established using the **Jakarta Persistence import** and **annotations**, including **@Entity, @Id, and @GeneratedValue**. This approach **facilitated the maintenance of the REST API**, making it more manageable and easier to maintain in the long run.
- **MySQL Workbench and DataGrip** were employed to **store employee information**. The **back-end**, developed with **Spring Boot**, was **configured to connect with the database**, while the **front-end**, built with **React**, was responsible for **retrieving and displaying** this information.
- **Spring Boot** was additionally utilised to **create custom exceptions**, specifically designed for **handling scenarios where the user ID was not found or encountered other exceptional conditions**.

### Postman and Testing Sceenshots
- **Postman** was used as an **API platform** to **design, build, test and iterate** the **RESTful API** which was **built using Spring Boot**.
- Requests were dealt in **JSON** and **SQL**.
